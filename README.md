<h1>Nmap and Network Reconnaissance Techniques</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

<b> Understanding Nmap:</b>

- Identified networking constructs directing traffic to server applications.
- Researched and provided information on available ports and "well-known" port numbers.

<b> Learning Nmap Switches:</b>
- Recognized and explained key Nmap switches for SYN scan, UDP scan, OS detection, version detection, verbosity control, output formatting, script activation, timing templates, and port specification.

<b> Scan Types Training:</b>

- Differentiated between basic (TCP Connect Scans, SYN Scans, UDP Scans) and less common port scan types.
- Highlighted advantages and disadvantages of each scan type.

<b> Detailed Explanations on Scan Types:</b>

- Elaborated on TCP Connect Scans, SYN Scans, and UDP Scans, including their interaction with target systems and potential outcomes.

<b> Working with NSE Scripts:</b>

- Utilized Nmap Scripting Language (NSE) for expanding Nmap functionality.
- Demonstrated script execution and searching methods for NSE scripts.

<b> Firewall Evasion Techniques:</b>

- Explored techniques for bypassing firewalls using stealthier scans and avoiding ICMP blocks.
- Discussed the usage of the -Pn flag in Nmap to bypass ICMP blocks.
<br />


<h2>Achievements:</h2>

- Successfully completed a comprehensive lab of the Tryhackme room "FurtherNmap," covering essential concepts and practical applications of Nmap
- Demonstrated proficiency in utilizing Nmap switches, understanding different port scan types, and employing NSE scripts for network reconnaissance
- Enhanced understanding of firewall evasion techniques and their significance in penetration testing scenarios

<h2>Skills Demonstrated: </h2>

- Proficiency in Nmap usage and command-line operations.
- Understanding of network protocols, port scanning techniques, and cybersecurity concepts.
- Research abilities for gathering relevant information on networking tools and techniques.
- Documentation and explanation skills to convey technical concepts effectively.
