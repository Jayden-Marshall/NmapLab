<h1>Nmap and Network Reconnaissance Techniques</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

The Nmap lab walkthrough aimed to provide practical experience in using Nmap, a powerful network scanning tool, for reconnaissance and enumeration tasks. Participants were guided through exercises covering basic Nmap commands, advanced scanning techniques, service version detection, and script scanning.

<b> Learning Nmap Switches:</b>
- Recognized and explained key Nmap switches for SYN scan, UDP scan, OS detection, version detection, verbosity control, output formatting, script activation, timing templates, and port specification.

<b> Scan Types Training:</b>

- Differentiated between basic (TCP Connect Scans, SYN Scans, UDP Scans) and less common port scan types.
- Highlighted advantages and disadvantages of each scan type.

<b> Detailed Explanations on Scan Types:</b>

- Elaborated on TCP Connect Scans, SYN Scans, and UDP Scans, including their interaction with target systems and potential outcomes.

<b> Working with NSE Scripts:</b>

- Utilized Nmap Scripting Language (NSE) for expanding Nmap functionality.
- Demonstrated script execution and searching methods for NSE scripts.

<b> Firewall Evasion Techniques:</b>

- Explored techniques for bypassing firewalls using stealthier scans and avoiding ICMP blocks.
- Discussed the usage of the -Pn flag in Nmap to bypass ICMP blocks.
