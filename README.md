<h1>Nmap and Network Reconnaissance Techniques</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

The Nmap lab walkthrough aimed to provide practical experience in using Nmap, a powerful network scanning tool, for reconnaissance and enumeration tasks. Participants were guided through exercises covering basic Nmap commands, advanced scanning techniques, service version detection, and script scanning.



<h2>Achievements:</h2>

- Successfully executed a variety of Nmap commands and scans, including TCP and UDP scans, SYN scans, and version detection, enhancing proficiency in using Nmap for network reconnaissance
- Explored advanced scanning techniques such as OS fingerprinting, service version detection, and script scanning, expanding knowledge of Nmap's capabilities and its utility in identifying network vulnerabilities
- Effectively identified open ports and running services on target systems, facilitating accurate assessment of network configurations and potential security risks
- Leveraged Nmap scripts to automate enumeration tasks and gather additional information about target systems, showcasing proficiency in using scripting capabilities for efficient reconnaissance

<h2>Skills Demonstrated: </h2>

- Demonstrated proficiency in conducting network reconnaissance using Nmap, including identifying open ports, services, and potential attack vectors within target environments
- Developed skills in utilizing a variety of scanning techniques, such as TCP SYN scans, UDP scans, and version detection, to comprehensively assess network security posture
- Enhanced ability to assess network vulnerabilities by analyzing Nmap scan results, identifying misconfigurations, and potential points of exploitation
- Demonstrated competency in using Nmap scripting engine for automating enumeration tasks, enabling efficient data collection and analysis during network reconnaissance
